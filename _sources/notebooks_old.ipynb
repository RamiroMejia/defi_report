    "    \n",
    "Blockchain is a distributed database in which a record of transactions made is shared and verified among the nodes of a computer network. Technology allowed for invention and adoptation of digital assets and decentralized financing among many others\n",

    "### What is Decentralized Financing (DeFi)\n",
    "    \n",
    "Decentralized Financing is a new form of trading and financing using blockchain. DeFi platforms allows for trading in Automated Market Maker with lowered fees and increased gains. Investors and traders deposit their money into pools (smart contracts) instead of trading against each unlike conventional exchange markets."
